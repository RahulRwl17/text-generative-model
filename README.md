# Plant Disease Q&A Chatbot using RNN
This repository contains a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model trained on a dataset of question-answer pairs related to plant diseases. The model has been developed to answer queries and provide information about various plant diseases and infections.

## Overview
The RNN-based chatbot leverages a dataset comprising 4000 records of question-answer pairs centered around plant diseases. However, the model has been trained on a subset of 2000 records from this dataset due to constraints. The data used for training has undergone prompt engineering techniques to enhance the chatbot's performance and text generation capabilities.
